In our first experiment we collected dataset of Java classes and calculated 
metrics and patterns for them. We calculated the readability using open-source
tool. Then we estimate the impact features to readability and conclude that
\emph{ncss\_method\_avg}, \emph{halstead\_volume}, and \emph{right\_spaces\_var} are
most important features. The more details you can find in \emph{Report 1}.

In second experiment we figured out non-zero correlation between the 
non-structural patterns and the code complexity metrics like \emph{Cyclomatic Complexity}
and \emph{NPath}. We observe that \emph{var\_in\_the\_middle} shows  
highest impact on complexity. We explain it by the fact that the more complex 
programs will  tend to have more variable and some of them declared in the middle
of the method body. The more details you can find in \emph{Report 2}.
