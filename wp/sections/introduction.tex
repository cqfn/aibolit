Last years we see that the number of papers, which are trying to apply ML to source 
code analysis, is growing. The researchers, encouraged by the success 
of ML, deep learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
are trying to adopt similar approaches to the code analysis.
In our new tool we make an attempt to automatically detect defects
in a software source code using ML and existing source code metrics,
such as Cyclomatic Complexity, cohesion, Number of Incoming Invocations, 
and others.

In Section~\ref{sec:related} we analyze existing tools and methods
of static analysis and identify the most important issues currently
present in modern instruments.

In Section~\ref{sec:categories} we classify existing ML-based
static analysis ideas by the type of input they expect, by the output
they produce, and some other qualities.

In Section~\ref{sec:data} we make an attempt to summarize the situation
with data availability on the market and give a few examples of the
most notable datasets freely available for researchers.

In Section~\ref{sec:criteria} we identify the most important criteria
for the selection of the method and the tool for ML-based static analysis.

In Section~\ref{sec:method} we introduce our own method of detecting
defects in the source code using ML and software code metrics.

In Section~\ref{sec:risks} we identify a number of risks we forecast
for the project and expect to mitigate.
