    A chained field is a field of some other field and so on.
    For example name of class field is retrieved like `field_decl.declarators[0].name`
    using javalang fields. To automate this chain fields can be used.
    Chain field is specified by sequence of strings (field names) and integers (list indexes).
    If a field is list of ASTNodes and next step in chain is string
    then we get that field from every node in list.
    If we get list of lists, it gets flatten.
    List with single items is unwrapped.
